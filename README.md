# 02-Challenge
the portfolio homework/challenge assignment
With this Web developer portfolio I wanted to go with a galaxy theme, this portfolio contains my name at the top, a subtitle, a short About me aread and a work area with 5 place holder images. there are also two unordered lists in this website, the first being in the nav at the top and the second being at the bottom in the contact me area. Instead of going with a dark background color I just used a dark image containg stars and used that as the background for the entire website. Below you will find two screenshots and the link to the deployed website.
